Core Framework

Author: Scott Huggins

The core framework is intented to automate databasing, form creation, permission/roles, and other mundane features to allow
creative and rapid prototyping.

Before run-time find: core/core/setup/config.php and set:
Error Modes
Database Connections etc.

The project is completely expermential. and deviates from standards - often.
